# react-native-airqualityinpoland
> This is my first project in react native used to monitor air quality in Poland using state system of sensors exposed via REST API [https://powietrze.gios.gov.pl/pjp/content/api](https://powietrze.gios.gov.pl/pjp/content/api).
> You can see the live demo of the app working here [https://snack.expo.dev/@vesolovski/react-native-airqualityinpoland](https://snack.expo.dev/@vesolovski/react-native-airqualityinpoland).
